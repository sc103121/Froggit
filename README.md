# Froggit
Froggit is the classic moving frog game created using python. The goal is to move the frog across the road and the river to reach all five destinations without losing all three lives. Drowning the river or getting hit by cars will decrease lives by one. The total number of lives is shown on the top right corner with the frog heads.
